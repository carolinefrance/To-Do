# To-Do
#### Caroline J. France
Last updated: 30 January 2023

* Created as an assignment for MiT's FSD Course, Module 14 (React, JS, CSS, Babel, HTML)

### SOURCE CODE
[MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/)
* The original code for this project was created by MiT faculty designers of this course, Abel Sanchez and John Williams (August 2022 - July 2023 cohort).

### Description:
This To-Do List project was modified from source code provided MIT xPro. Some of the JavaScript is transpiled with Babel. It includes five files, as the JavaScript is refactored into three files.

#### Files
* index.html
* styles.css
* index.js
* form.js
* todo.js

Caroline France modified styles.css from MIT's source code.

### How to Run

#### Step 1: download and unzip files from this repository to your computer
* From this repository, click [<> Code ] and select Download ZIP
* Unzip these files, and move them to a folder (a.k.a. a directory)

#### Step 2: set up a local server on your computer

* MAC: open Terminal
* PC: open Command Prompt

Locate the directory (ls) where you placed the unzipped files, then type the following:
* npm install -- global http-server
* http-server -c-1

#### Step 3: open your browser
* Copy and paste the localhost:8080 link into your browser's address bar.

#### Step 4: view the To-Do List app
* You can click on a list item to remove it.
* You can click on "Add item..." and type a new item to add to the list.

#### Step 5: to close the app, quit your local server
* MAC: open Terminal, command C
* PC: open Command Prompt, ctrl C

### Roadmap for future improvements:
* I will adjust this template for future React web projects for which I need the user to add or remove text and the state of the browser needs to be updated.
